# RightfulShare

## Overview

[RightfulShare](rightfulshare.org), is a first-of-a-kind project that aims to create a more accessible and fair economy, starting with a small rural community in South Africa, the most unequal country in the world.

Our mission is to distribute a digital basic income while simultaneously building a micro-economy using tokenomics to promote entrepreneurship and innovation.

Our approach is unique in that we’re not just talking about change – we’re actually creating a working model of a fair economy that everyone can see in action.

We want to give aspirational and ambitious South Africans who are currently locked out of opportunities the chance to increase and diversify their income streams, to learn and to build their wealth.

We want to demonstrate that it is possible and more effective to give socio-economic investment money directly to citizens. Socio-economic investment can go straight into the hands of beneficiaries as a basic income. It will save corporates time and money by removing the need for overly bureaucratic programmes and complicated scorecards.

Blockchain technology further reduces the opportunities for corruption by reducing the discretionary power of government officials and cutting out intermediaries.
